# swedish-railway-system
A python project part of a Linear Algebra course at KTH. 

Contents of the different datasets:

data.gpkg: Information about which stations have connections/links to each other, including all currently used and unused stations. Under the comment #Load the data, these points are converted into a Gram matrix.

stations.gpkg: Information about connections/links as they were previously, but without unused stations - in other words, only stations where passengers can get on and off.
